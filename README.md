# MathCode

A repository where code related to solving mathematical problems is kept 

As of now Matrices (of some dimensions) are supported with some generalised functions for matrices of different dimensions.

> OpenCL / GPU computation will be added soon

## Matrics
1. Basic operations on matrices
2. Generalised functions for matrices
3. Parse MATLAB format matrices

## Vectors
1. Basic vector types added
2. Basic vector operations added
