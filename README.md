# MathCode

A repository where code related to solving mathematical problems is kept 

As of now Matrices (of some dimensions) are supported with some generalised functions for matrices of different dimensions.

> This library is unnder development and shall be used as experimental and not in production
> New features coming soon
> OpenCL / GPU computation will be added soon
