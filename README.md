# MathCode

A repository where code related to solving mathematical problems is kept 

As of now Matrices (of some dimensions) are supported with some generalised functions for matrices of different dimensions.

> This library is unnder development and shall be used as experimental and not in production
> New features coming soon
> OpenCL / GPU computation will be added soon

## Compattibility
- Compilers
  - AMD Optimizing C/C++ Compiler (AOCC)
  - GCC
  - Clang
  - Intel Compiler (not tested) 

## Matrics
1. Basic operations on matrices
2. Generalised functions for matrices
3. Parse MATLAB format matrices

## Vectors
