# MathCode

A repository where code related to solving mathematical problems is kept 

As of now Matrices (of some dimensions) are supported with some generalised functions for matrices of different dimensions.

> This library is unnder development and shall be used as experimental and not in production    
> New features coming soon    
> OpenCL / GPU computation will be added soon including other paralel computation technologies.
> Vulkan / OpenCL is priority for now (because of its wide support in multiple Operating Systems)
